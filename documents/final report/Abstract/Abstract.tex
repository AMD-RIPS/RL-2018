Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where algorithms learn from experience while dynamically interacting with an environment. RL approaches have recently achieved superhuman performance in games such as Go, Chess, and classic video games. However, these algorithms are sensitive to perturbations in the environment and often struggle or catastrophically fail when applied to environments that differ from where they were trained. RL methods must become more robust if they are to become certified and deployed in the real-world. This project investigated the performance of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm on an unsolved OpenAI car racing game challenge. The report begins with an overview of reinforcement learning and the methods used for the car racing game. This is followed by a description of a tuned DQN algorithm that solves this particular challenge. The algorithmâ€™s sensitivity to changes in feedback and input image characteristics are discussed. This report concludes with a discussion of the generalizability of these algorithms, techniques for improving their robustness, and future work needed to achieve autonomous RL algorithms.
