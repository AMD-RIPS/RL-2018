%It is appropriate in the Acknowledgments to thank individuals or organizations who made especially noteworthy contributions to your project.
%Elsewhere, within the body of the report, you can acknowledge more specific contributions where appropriate.
%These are matters of courtesy and professional ethics.
%As an example:
%
%\begin{quote}
%The RIPS {\LaTeX} report template has been developed by Mike Raugh with advice and assistance from Oleg 
%Alexandrov and Shawn Cokus in the early stage of development and general support of IPAM and the System Administration staff.
%The first RIPS template was based on an early version of the Math Clinic's report template at 
%Harvey Mudd College;
%there the original template has been improved and is managed by Claire Connelly, the HMC Math Department's system administrator.  
%Claire and her co-authors offer coding advice, a wealth of references, and a note about the origin of the template in their current 
%edition, the $\texttt{sample-clinic-report.pdf}$ accessible at $\texttt{ http://www.math.hmc.edu/computing/support/tex/sample-report}$.
%Claire copyedited the third edition of Gr\"{a}tzer's \emph{Math into {LaTeX}}, most of which
%work seems to have survived into the fourth edition:  \emph{More Math into {LaTeX}} \cite{gratzer}.

%When acknowledging individuals in this section, it is OK to use the names by which you know and speak to them.
%Here it is OK to write ``Oleg Alexandrov.''
%But you must be formal on the Title page and elsewhere within the report, where it is proper to specify honorifics, e.g., Dr. or Prof.
%On the Title page you would write ``Dr. Oleg Alexandrov,''
%and likewise within the body of the report if you were acknowledging him for a specific contribution, 
%Claire Connelly uses no honorific, so you would use just her name on the title page.
%When in doubt, check the person's business card or follow usage on the person's web page.

%As a result of suggestions from users, this Sample Report and its source are under continual improvement.
%Please contact the RIPS program director for your suggestions.
%An up-to-date  list of changes is recorded in the "Revisions" folder for the Master Template Folder.
