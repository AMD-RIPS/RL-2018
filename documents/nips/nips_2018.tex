% \begin{abstract}
% Deep Reinforcement Learning methods have seen many successes in recent years, ranging from solving classical video games to beating world class Go players. However, successful models are typically trained for narrow, well-defined tasks using a vast amount of computation. They perform well in their defined task, but slight perturbations in the environment often cause disproportionate reductions in performance. In this paper, we provide an example which suggests that regularization methods could improve the generalizability of deep RL algorithms. We present a solution to OpenAI’s Car Racing environment where the agent observes only a small subset of the state space during training by applying the DDQN-algorithm with dropout.
% \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Deep reinforcement learning methods have proven successful in solving well-defined computer games. In particular, the DDQN algorithm has achieved superhuman performance in several Atari games \cite{DQN}. However, deep RL agents are limited by their sensitivity to perturbations in the environment. They can fail catastrophically when applied to environments that differ even slightly from where they were trained.

The OpenAI Gym’s CarRacing-v0 environment \cite{CarRacing} is a top-down view car racing game where the goal is to visit all tiles of the racetrack as quickly as possible. The agent receives a reward of $-0.1$ at each time step and $\frac{1000}{N}$ for each track tile visited, where $N$ is the total number of tiles in the racetrack. The state is represented by $96\times96$ RGB screenshots of the game. The game ends when the agent visits all tiles on the track or when 1000 frames have passed. This environment is considered solved by OpenAI’s guidelines when the agent achieves an average score of 900 or above over 100 consecutive games. This game is particularly challenging because the racetrack is randomly generated, which introduces stochasticity and complexity into the environment.  The challenge has been solved using a generative neural network model \cite{World_Models}, but previous attempts using deep RL methods have not been successful \cite{CarRacing1}. % cite something here.

In this paper, we describe a deep RL algorithm that uses a convolutional architecture with dropout that successfully solves the game. Remarkably, the model is trained on a limited environment made up of 3 tracks. This result shows that regularization methods such as dropout can mitigate the overfit usually exhibited by deep RL. To the best of our knowledge, this solution is the first to solve the challenge using deep RL.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\section{Method}
We adapted the DDQN algorithm \cite{DDQN} for our approach. The input to the Q-network is a $96\times96\times4$ image produced by stacking 4 consecutive frames of the game while the output is five dimensional, corresponding to the elements of the discretized action space. As proposed in the original DQN algorithm \cite{DQN}, the architecture for the Q-network consists of 3 convolutional layers followed by 2 dense layers and an output for each of the 5 actions. Each hidden layer is followed by a rectified nonlinearity. Dropout is applied to the second convolutional layer. We train over a maximum of 3000 episodes and use early stopping to ensure that the best performing model is selected for analysis.

We trained several models with varying observability of the state space. First, we train the model on a single racetrack. Second, we randomly alternate between 3 fixed racetracks. Third, the agent is shown random racetracks from the state space. All models are tested on random racetracks. We performed a baseline experiment with no dropout and experimented with the dropout probability. The results from the best performing models are displayed in Table \ref{tab:scores}.

\section{Performance Analysis}
As shown in Table \ref{tab:scores}, the average scores over 100 random games improved in all three environments when dropout was applied to the Q-network. This suggests that dropout acts as an effective regularizer by improving the agent's performance in situations it has not observed during training. In order to investigate the generalizability of these models, we developed a curve classification algorithm. Each curve in the racetrack is charactertized as either a Left, Right, or S-shaped curve. Then, the steepness of the curve is ranked from 1 to 3, where 1 represents a shallow curve and 3 represents a steep curve. For each of these different types of curves, we record the percentage of tiles cleared.  

\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
      \textbf{Environment} & \textbf{Dropout} & \textbf{Average Score}\\
      \hline
      1 Fixed Track & None & $849.99\pm78.72$ \\
      3 Fixed Tracks & None & $853.88\pm127.71$ \\
      Random Tracks & None & $854.83\pm107.14$ \\
      1 Fixed Track & $0.7$ & $894.38\pm24.5$ \\
      3 Fixed Tracks & $0.5$ & $906.67\pm23.6$ \\
      Random Tracks & $0.5$ & $892.62\pm41.48$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.1cm}
    \caption{Average scores over 100 consecutive games on random racetracks. Test tracks were generated from random seeds 1 through 100. }
    \label{tab:scores}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
\vspace{-5mm}

Figure \ref{fig:curves_comparison} compares the performance of the models trained on a single racetrack. Even though both models were trained on the same racetrack, the model with dropout performed better than the model without dropout, especially on curves that the agent did not see examples of during training. This indicates that using dropout is an effective regularizer and improves the generalizability of these models.

\section{Conclusion}
We demonstrated a deep RL solution to CarRacing-v0 where the agent was trained on a limited subset of the state space. Even with partial knowledge about the environment, the agent is capable of making informed decisions. By applying dropout as a regularization technique, we improved the algorithm's ability to generalize to situations it has not observed during training. These results suggest that widespread regularization techniques such as dropout could be successfully applied to deep RL algorithms to make them more robust under partial observability of the environment.

% \section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2018}

% NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
% is
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2018/}
% \end{center}

% Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

% \subsection{Style}

% Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2018 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
% long, including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only
%   acknowledgments and/or cited references} are allowed. Papers that
% exceed eight pages of content (ignoring references) will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the
% conference.

% The margins in 2018 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
% $\sim$$15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

% Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
% at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
% current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
% be grounds for rejection.

% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}

% The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
% available on the World Wide Web at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+nips_2018.pdf+ contains these instructions and
% illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
% satisfy.

% The only supported style file for NIPS 2018 is \verb+nips_2018.sty+,
% rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
%   2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

% The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+,
% which creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a
% preprint for submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will
% not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

% \paragraph{New preprint option for 2018}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv,
% using the NIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will
% create a nonanonymized version of your work with the text
% ``Preprint. Work in progress.''  in the footer. This version may be
% distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do not} use the
% \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for papers
% accepted to NIPS.

% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper
% as they will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

% The file \verb+nips_2018.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
% your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
% and text of the paper with your own.

% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
% summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
% \ref{others} below.

% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
% wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
% (9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
% 11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
% will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
% \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
% centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
% thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
% \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
% pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

% For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
% name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
% name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
% different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
% list both author and co-author side by side.

% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}

% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
% nouns), flush left, and bold.

% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

% \subsection{Headings: second level}

% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}

% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \paragraph{Paragraphs}

% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
% heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
% heading followed by 1\,em of space.

% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}

% These instructions apply to everyone.

% \subsection{Citations within the text}

% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
% Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
% internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
% any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
% appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}

% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
% add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2018+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}

% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
% the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2018}
% \end{verbatim}

% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
% third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
% al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
% papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
% review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
% of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
% indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
%   footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
% page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
% rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}

% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
% enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
% always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
% caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
% numbered consecutively.

% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
% captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
% either black/white or in color.

% \subsection{Tables}

% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
% number and title always appear before the table.  See
% Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.

% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
%   rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
% which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \section{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
% files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
% rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
% (except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
% note that pages should be numbered.

% \section{Preparing PDF files}

% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
% not, for example, ``A4.''

% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
% must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
% instructions to achieve this.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
%   select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
%   All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
%   with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
%   machines.

% \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
%   fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
%   \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
%   fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
%   should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
% \verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
% can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
% \verb+amssymb+ package.

% \end{itemize}

% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
% will ask you to fix it.

% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
% specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
% example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
% hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
% \verb+\-+ command when necessary.

% \subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

% Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
% acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
% acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.
