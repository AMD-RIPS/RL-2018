\begin{abstract}
Deep Reinforcement Learning methods have seen many successes in recent years, ranging from solving classical video games to beating 
world class Go players. However, little progress has been made on the front of generalizability: successful models are trained for 
narrow, well-defined tasks, often using a vast amount of compute time. These models perform well in their specific task, but slight 
perturbations in the environment often cause disproportionate decrease in performance. Regularization methods have not yet been shown 
successful in tackling this issue of overfit. In this paper we attempt to give such a positive example, by applying the DDQN-algorithm 
with Dropout to solve OpenAI's CarRacing environment, using only a small subset of the state space for training. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
% The field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) concerns itself with the task of learning from interaction to maximize a reward signal. 
% In the setting of this interaction, the decision maker is called the \textit{agent} and the world it interacts with is called the 
% \textit{environment}. At each time step the \textit{agent} chooses and \textit{action} to take, and the environment responds with 
% resulting \textit{state} of the environment and a scalar \textit{reward} signal. 
% \par

Deep reinforcement learning allows an agent to learn through experience while
dynamically interacting with an environment. Computer games are often used as
a sandbox for investigating deep reinforcement learning algorithms because they
provide an easy way to generate large amounts of data for experience. RL
methods have achieved some success in learning how to play computer games using
only images and score as input. In particular, DeepMind’s DQN algorithm reached
superhuman performance in several Atari games \cite{DQNPaper}.

However, RL methods are limited by their sensitivity to perturbations in the
environment. They can fail catastrophically when applied to environments that
differ from where they were trained. Additionally, they typically require
millions of frames of experience and days of training. It is crucial for these
methods to become more robust if they are to be deployed in the real world.

We investigate OpenAI Gym’s CarRacing-v0 environment [ref?], which is a simple,
top-down view racing game as shown in Figure \ref{fig:carracing}. The
environment includes a racecar, a race track composed of tiles, and grass. The
agent has control of the racecar, and its goal is to visit the tiles of the
randomly generated race track as quickly as possible. The agent receives
a \textit{reward} of -0.1 at each time step and $+\frac{1000}{Number\ of\
tiles}$ for each track tile visited. The \textit{state} is represented by 96x96
RGB screenshots of the game. The game ends when the agent visits all tiles on
the track or when 1000 frames have passed. This environment is considered
solved by OpenAI's guidelines when the agent achieves an average score of 900
or above over 100 consecutive games. This car racing game was recently solved
by \cite{World_Models} using generative methods. To the best of our knowledge,
it is previously unsolved using RL methods.

% OpenAI Gym is a set of Reinforcement Learning testbeds including many classical video games and control problems. OpenAI Gym's 
% CarRacing environment - from here on referred to as the 'car racing game' - is a simple, top-down view racing game, shown in 
% Figure \ref{fig:carracing}. The player has control of a race-car, and its goal is to visit the tiles making up the randomly 
% generated track, as fast as possible. At each frame, the score changes by -0.1 if no tile was visited and by 
% $\frac{1000}{N}$ otherwise, where N=Number of tiles on the track. The emulator returns 96 by 96 RGB screenshots 
% of the screen at each frame. The game ends if the race-car visits all tiles on the track, or if the number of passed frames exceeds 1000. The environment is considered solved as per OpenAI's guidelines, if an average score of over 900 is achieved over 100 consecutive 
% games. The car racing game was recently solved by \cite{World_Models}, however to the best of our knowledge it is unsolved 
% using RL methods.

In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that uses a convolutional architecture with dropout that 
successfully solves the game. Remarkably the model is trained on a limited environment made up of 3 tracks. This result 
shows that regularisation methods such as dropout can mitigate the overfit usually exhibited by these Deep Reinforcement Learning methods. Our code can be found at \textit{https://github.com/AMD-RIPS/RL-2018}, and video of the best performing model can be found under \textit{TODO}

\section{Method}

\subsection{Model}
We use the DDQN-algorithm for our experiments, as first described in \cite{DDQN}. It is a simple extension of the celebrated DQN-algorithm, 
proposed in \cite{DQN}. The architecture of the Q-network is that described in the original paper \cite{DQN}, consisting of
3 convolutional layers followed by 2 dense layers and the output layer. The input to the network is a 96 $\times$ 96 $\times$ 4 image 
produced by stacking 4 consectuive frames of the game. Dropout (for a definition see \cite{Dropout}) is added to the second convolutional layer only, with a drop probability of 0.5. 

\subsection{Analyzing performance}
We use two methods to analyze the performance of our models. The first one is to perform 100 consecutive test runs on randomly generated tracks, recording the average score. The second is to measure how the models perform on different types of curves in a racetrack. To do so, we developed a simple curve classification algorithm, which is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:curves}. Each curve is characterized as either a Left, Right, or S-shaped curve. An S-shaped curve is either a left turn followed by a right turn or a right turn followed by a left turn. Then, the steepness of the curve is ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 represents a very shallow curve and 5 represents a very steep curve. For each of these different types of curves we record the average percentage of tiles cleared.

\caption{Comparison of the 6 models with 'Baseline' referring to models without dropout. The red line indicates the average score required to solve the environment. }
\label{fig:scores}
\end{figure}

\section{Experiments}

We train on three different environments: a single track, 3 different tracks and randomly generated tracks. We train on each of these environments both with and without dropout, giving a total of 6 training sessions. It is worth noting that the same fixed tracks were used for the first two environments when training with and without dropout. Training is over 3000 episodes and early stopping is used: only the best performing model is selected to be analyzed. Boxplots of the scores over 100 consecutive games for the 6 models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:scores}. The model trained on 3 tracks using dropout achieves an average score of over 906 with standard deviation $\sim$23, thereby solving the environment. 
\par

We used the curve characterization method to quantitatively measure whether applying dropout improved the ability to generalize to curves  not seen during training. In particular, we analyzed the models that were trained on a single track, because these models only encountered a limited number of different types of curves during training. Even though both models were trained on the same track, the model with dropout performed better on each curve type. These results are demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:curves_comparison}. This indicates that using dropout indeed allows for better generalization to curves not seen during training. Thus, dropout has the potential to be an effective regularizer in deep reinforcement learning problems.

% \section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2018}

% NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
% is
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2018/}
% \end{center}

% Please read the instructions below carefully and follow them faithfully.

% \subsection{Style}

% Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2018 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
% long, including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only
%   acknowledgments and/or cited references} are allowed. Papers that
% exceed eight pages of content (ignoring references) will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the
% conference.

% The margins in 2018 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
% $\sim$$15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

% Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
% at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
% current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
% be grounds for rejection.

% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}

% The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
% available on the World Wide Web at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+nips_2018.pdf+ contains these instructions and
% illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
% satisfy.

% The only supported style file for NIPS 2018 is \verb+nips_2018.sty+,
% rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
%   2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

% The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+,
% which creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a
% preprint for submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will
% not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.

% \paragraph{New preprint option for 2018}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv,
% using the NIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will
% create a nonanonymized version of your work with the text
% ``Preprint. Work in progress.''  in the footer. This version may be
% distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do not} use the
% \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for papers
% accepted to NIPS.

% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper
% as they will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

% The file \verb+nips_2018.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
% your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
% and text of the paper with your own.

% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
% summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
% \ref{others} below.

% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
% wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
% (9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
% 11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
% will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
% \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
% centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
% thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
% \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
% pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

% For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
% name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
% name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
% different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
% list both author and co-author side by side.

% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}

% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
% nouns), flush left, and bold.

% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

% \subsection{Headings: second level}

% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}

% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

% \paragraph{Paragraphs}

% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
% heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
% heading followed by 1\,em of space.

% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}

% These instructions apply to everyone.

% \subsection{Citations within the text}

% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
% Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
% internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
% any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
% appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}

% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
% add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2018+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}

% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
% the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2018}
% \end{verbatim}

% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
% third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
% al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
% papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
% review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
% of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
% indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
%   footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
% page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
% rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

% \subsection{Figures}

% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}

% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
% enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
% always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
% caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
% numbered consecutively.

% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
% captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
% either black/white or in color.

% \subsection{Tables}

% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
% number and title always appear before the table.  See
% Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.

% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
%   rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
% which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \section{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
% files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
% rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
% (except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
% note that pages should be numbered.

% \section{Preparing PDF files}

% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
% not, for example, ``A4.''

% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
% must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
% instructions to achieve this.

% \begin{itemize}

% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
%   select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
%   All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
%   with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
%   machines.

% \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
%   fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
%   \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
%   fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
%   should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
% \verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
% can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
% \verb+amssymb+ package.

% \end{itemize}

% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
% will ask you to fix it.

% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
% specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
% example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
% hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
% \verb+\-+ command when necessary.

% \subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

% Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
% acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
% acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.
