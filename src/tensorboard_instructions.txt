When you run run_deep_q.py, tensorboard starts up automatically. In the terminal it tells you what address to go to in your browser of choice to get to tensorboard. 
In case of error 'TensorBoard attempted to bind to port 6006, but it was already in use', do
'ps aux | grep tensorboard'
and then kill the process using
'kill <PID>'
